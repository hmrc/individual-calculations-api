      Here a developer can:
        - list self-assessment tax calculations for a given National Insurance number (NINO) and tax year
        - trigger a self-assessment tax calculation for a given tax year
        - retrieve all the tax calculation data for a given NINO and Calculation ID
  - name: Final Declaration
    description: |
      **Final declaration was previously called crystallisation.**
      
      This resource allows software packages to make a final declaration regarding a customer’s end of year position for a tax year.
    
      Before starting the final declaration journey the software package will need to ensure that, for the relevant tax year, the customer:
        - has already provided their entire income e.g. interest, dividends, other SA schedules
        - does not have any additional information to provide
      
      Here, the developer can:      
        - submit final declaration for a tax year
