**Final declaration was previously called Crystallisation.**

These resources allow software packages to make a final declaration regarding a customer’s end of year position for a tax year.

Before starting the final declaration journey the software package will need to ensure that, for the relevant tax year, the customer:

- has finalised EOPS for all their businesses (self-employment and uk-property)
- has already provided their entire income e.g. interest, dividends, other SA schedules
- does not have any additional information to provide

Here, the developer can:

- provide the customer’s intent to make a final declaration, for which they will receive a Calculation ID
- submit final declaration for a tax year
