    # Overview
    
    This API allows a developer to:
  
    * trigger a customer’s self assessment tax calculation
    * list a customer’s self assessment tax calculations for a tax year
    * retrieve a customer’s self assessment tax calculation result
    * submit a self assessment final declaration for a tax year
    
    In previous versions, the term ‘crystallise’ was used to mean submit a final declaration, and the term ‘intent to crystallise’ was used to mean trigger a final declaration self-assessment tax calculation.
    
    For information on how to connect to this API [see the Income Tax MTD end-to-end service guide](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/guides/income-tax-mtd-end-to-end-service-guide/).

    description: |
      **Final declaration was previously called crystallisation.**
  
      This resource allows software packages to make a final declaration regarding a customer’s end of year position for a tax year.
    
      Before starting the final declaration journey the software package will need to ensure that, for the relevant tax year, the customer:
      
        - has finalised EOPS for all their businesses (self-employment, uk-property and foreign property)
        - has already provided their entire income e.g. interest, dividends, other SA schedules
        - does not have any additional information to provide
      
      Here, the developer can:
      
        - submit final declaration for a tax year
