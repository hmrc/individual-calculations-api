  summary: Trigger a Self Assessment Tax Calculation
  description: |
    This endpoint allows the user to trigger a self assessment tax calculation for a given tax year. 
    It should be called whenever income data is updated through a periodic or annual endpoint. 
    To trigger a final declaration self assessment tax calculation, 
    you must supply the finalDeclaration query parameter as true. 
    
    A National Insurance number and tax year must be provided. 
    
    The tax calculation process is asynchronous, so it is recommended you wait at least 5 seconds 
    before calling the retrieval endpoint. 
    The result of the calculation can be seen using the 
    “Retrieve a Self Assessment Tax Calculation” endpoint.
    
    ### Test data
    Scenario simulations using `Gov-Test-Scenario` headers is only available in the sandbox environment.
    
    | Header Value (Gov-Test-Scenario)   | Scenario                                                                                                           |
    |------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | N/A - DEFAULT                      | Simulates success response.                                                                                        |
    | NO_INCOME_SUBMISSIONS_EXIST        | Simulates the scenario where no income submissions exist for the tax year.                                       |
    | FINAL_DECLARATION_RECEIVED         | Simulates the scenario where a final declaration has already been received.                                       |
    | INCOME_SOURCES_CHANGED             | Simulates the scenario where income sources data has changed.                                                     |
    | RECENT_SUBMISSIONS_EXIST           | Simulates the scenario where more recent submissions exist.                                                       |
    | RESIDENCY_CHANGED                  | Simulates the scenario where residency has changed.                                                               |
    | CALCULATION_IN_PROGRESS            | Simulates the scenario where a calculation is in progress.                                                        |
    | BUSINESS_VALIDATION_FAILURE        | Simulates the scenario where there is a generic business validation rule failure.                                 |
    | TAX_YEAR_NOT_ENDED                 | Simulates the scenario where triggering for a final declaration is performed before the tax year has ended.       |
