displayName: Trigger a Self Assessment Tax Calculation [test only]
description: 'This endpoint allows the user to trigger a self assessment tax calculation for a given tax year. It should be called whenever income data is updated through a periodic or annual endpoint. To trigger a final declaration self assessment tax calculation, you must supply the finalDeclaration query parameter as true. <br/> <br/> A National Insurance number and tax year must be provided. The tax calculation process is asynchronous, so it is recommended you wait at least 5 seconds before calling the retrieval endpoint. The result of the calculation can be seen using the “Retrieve a Self Assessment Tax Calculation” endpoint.'
