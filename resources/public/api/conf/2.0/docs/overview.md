This API allows a developer to:

* trigger a customer’s self-assessment tax calculation
* list a customer’s self-assessment tax calculations for a tax year
* retrieve a customer’s self-assessment tax calculation result using multiple endpoints
* provide the customer’s intent to make a final declaration, for which they will receive a Calculation ID
* submit a final declaration for a tax year
