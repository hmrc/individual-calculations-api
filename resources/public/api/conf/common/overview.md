This API allows a developer to:

* trigger a customer’s self assessment tax calculation
* list a customer’s self assessment tax calculations for a tax year
* retrieve a customer’s self assessment tax calculation result
* submit a self assessment final declaration for a tax year

In previous versions, the term ‘crystallise’ was used to mean submit a final declaration, and the term ‘intent to crystallise’ 
was used to mean trigger a final declaration self-assessment tax calculation.

For information on how to connect to this API [see the Income Tax MTD end-to-end service guide](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/guides/income-tax-mtd-end-to-end-service-guide/).
